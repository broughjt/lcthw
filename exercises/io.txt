int fscanf(FILE *restrict stream, const char *restrict format, ...);
Scans input according to a format

char *fgets(char * restrict str, int size, FILE * restrict stream);
Reads at most size - 1 characters from stream into str

FILE *fopen(const char * restrict path, const char * restrict mode);
Opens file at path and associates a stream with it

FILE *freopen(const char *path, const char *mode, FILE *stream);
Opens file at path, associates stream with it, and closes original stream if it exists

FILE *fdopen(int fildes, const char *mode);
Associates stream with existing file descriptor fildes

int fclose(FILE *stream);
Dissociates stream from underlying file. If stream was being used for output, buffered output is flushed first, using fflush

void fcloseall(void);
Calls fclose on all open streams

int fgetpos(FILE *restrict stream, fpos_t *restrict pos);
Portable version of ftell that uses type fpos_t instead of long int. Gets current file position

int fseek(FILE *stream, long offset, int whence);
Sets position on stream to whence + offset, where whence can be some special constants like the start, current position, or end of file

long ftell(FILE *stream);
Gets the current position of stream

void rewind(FILE *stream);
Sets stream's position to the beginning of the file

int fprintf(FILE *restrict stream, const char *restrict format, ...);
Writes formatted output to stream

size_t fwrite(const void *restrict ptr, size_t size, size_t nitems, FILE *restrict stream);
Writes nitems objects of size bytes to stream, getting them from ptr

size_t fread(void *restrict ptr, size_t size, size_t nitems, FILE *restrict stream);
Reads nitems objects of size bytes from location pointed at by ptr to stream
